# KoreanComicTranslator
I will be using my interests with a real life problem to motivate myself to learn and practice what I have learned so far in General Assembly, that includes: APIs, HTML, CSS, and HTML DOM with JavaScript; to then use what I learned for future projects.

Added Tesseract OCR library's other supported languages besides Korean for text recognition, users can translate any image with the free rapid google translate API's supported languages.
